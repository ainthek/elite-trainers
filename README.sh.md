# elite-trainers

This document describes my personal experiences with bike trainers and specially the software from <http://www.elite-it.com>.

They are wonderful, and I love them and have a big respect to the
elite company team, for the work they have done and for what they deliver. This is my honest statement, regardless of what you read next. 

## Background Story

I'm a lame cyclist and IT professional with enough passion and money to have: 

- my own 2 kids with their 3 bikes (1x20'' BMX, 1x 20'' MTB, 1x 24'' MTB) ,
- legal wife with 1 bike (26'' MTB)
- and me having 2 bikes for my self (24'' BMX and 26'' MTB, which is more line 27,5'' when pumped) 

This range of wheel sizes is my main motivation for choosing elite as 
the brand ([see wheel sizes compatibility sheet](TODO: link))



Having so many bikes, and bikers at home I ended up having 2 machines now:

- [QUBO POWER FLUID](http://www.elite-it.com/en/products/trainers/indoor-trainers/qubo-power-fluid-0), I have more than one year
- [QUBO DIGITAL SMART B+](http://www.elite-it.com/en/products/trainers/indoor-trainers/qubo-power-smart-b) which I have since yesterday (18.1.2016)

I also we have several devices at home:

- iPad 3
- iPhone 6
- and some sort of Android (which I do not know how to operate , so it is not included here in detail)

I also have Apple TV (4th generation) and one TV.

I also decided to be an 'assistant trainer' at the local BMX club lately, 
which I can use as an excuse for 
my interest and money spend on trainers machines experimenting.

## Review

Explained my IT background, bike ranges and lame cycling, here are my experiences.

### HW - trainers

Beautiful pieces of hardware, elegant , easy to assemble and the axle bundled with them is really helpful, if you do not want to destroy your original one. 

Takes 10 minutes to build it up and have it running.

Beware: always use pad under the machine, if you do not you will destroy your wooden floor. Even if the pads and plastic, it can leave scratches when you move the trainer, to clean the flat or just by sprint pedaling.

### Wheels and noise

Kids wheels are fine (9 years on any wheels will not produce to much noise), 
but for my MTB I had to build a special slick wheel, 
otherwise the noise is terrible (we have neighbors under out flat).

The Fluid machines itself are super silent (good job, elite team).

### Mechanical - QUBO POWER FLUID

I have used this without any electronics for a while.
It works well with well defined speed/power characteristics and
just shifting on your bike. Nice. 

### Mechanical QUBO POWER FLUID + 3rd party speed and cadence meter

One day, I have decided to buy cadence and speed meter from e-bay.
I have installed several apps and used the trainer with them, all fine and then i Have mad a mistake, I have remembered the poster packed with trainer machine, 
and the 'fun' started.

I have installed [My E-Training](http://www.elite-it.com/en/products/trainers/app/app-my-e-training) on iPhone and hoped it will connect to Chinese speedometer.

It did ! (great job), for 20$ I had a digital trainer now.
Could ride on map, by video, by training program...

But, it did not go harder when climbing the hill nor easier when riding downhill.

### Going Digital (QUBO DIGITAL SMART B+) 

Happy with the mechanical QUBO POWER FLUID with Chinese gadget,  
I have decided to buy also QUBO DIGITAL SMART B+. B+ is for Bluetooth.
And I hoped I will not need to buy a ANT+ dongle (no worries, no need, good job elite team).

Expected to measure speed, cadence (I already had for 20$) and 
having a mobile controlled resistance based on Watt power in trainings program, 
and elevation profile in videos and maps.

![](./QuboDigital_Smart_Bplus-2.jpg)

Yes it all works (good job). Even if the cadence is ['fake'](TODO: link), it seems to 
measure and display something. 

(TODO: numbers will be tested/compared against the Chinese gadget soon)

### My E training

I tried to use 'both variations of my setup' with My E Training application, 
which is free , but usable only after paying 10$ a year subscription. (click, click, click I have a full version now with year subscription). And now the 'fun starts'.

This is the official [help](http://www.elite-it.info/myETraining/helpEnglish_v1.htm).

In the following chapters I will try to comment on usability of each feature and
also about my 'progress' with support from elite help desk.

#### Settings

	The app must be configured when first loading it so that it perfectly matches your hometrainer. 


- (cons) Application is unusable without setting trainer machine and sensors. If you just want to download videos, or creating new training program you HAVE TO SETUP training machine type, and even to setup sensors. If you have no sensors, application is UNUSABLE for anything. VERY BAD DESIGN !

![screenshots of terrible UX, useless step](./settings/settings.jpg)

- (cons) it allows you to set only one training machine, one type of sensor and one rider parameters (bike wheel size, weight, age). if you are in my situation having 4 riders with at least 2 bikes, it means switching manually configuration when the riders change. I expect it is more usual to have more riders the smart phones in family, I would suggest to have 'profiles' and being able to switch them quickly (even my 30$ Withings scale have it), so for 300+ $ machine + 10$ SW for a year subscription, that would be a fair requirement. Or not ?

#### Base training sessions

- (cons) I have 3 items on the screen, why they do not match my large iPhone 6 display ?
